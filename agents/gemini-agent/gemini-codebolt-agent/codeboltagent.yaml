initial_message: |
  Hello! I'm a software engineering assistant modeled after Gemini CLI.
  I can help you with reading, writing, and debugging code,
  running commands, searching your codebase, and navigating your project.
  I rigorously adhere to existing project conventions and always verify before assuming.

description: A Gemini CLI-equivalent agent built on Codebolt Agent SDK v2
longDescription: >
  This agent replicates the full behavior of Google's Gemini CLI,
  including its multi-section prompt system, 3-method loop detection,
  conversation compression, next-speaker continuation logic,
  model routing, user/project memory, plan mode, and git workflow guidelines.
  Built using Codebolt Agent SDK v2 Level 2 (Base Components) with
  Level 1 augmentation for memory and sub-agent orchestration.
