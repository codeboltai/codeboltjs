   - Preserves module structure
   - Includes separate `.js` and `.d.ts` files
   - **Recommended for npm publishing and development**

2. **Webpack Build** (`npm run build:webpack`)
   - Outputs to `build/bundle.js`
   - Single bundled file
   - Optimized for production deployment
   - **Works in Node.js environments**
