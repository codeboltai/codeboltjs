# TUI Connection Integration Test

## Summary
Successfully implemented TUI connection support in the Codebolt agent server.

## Changes Made

### 1. TUI Connections Manager (`tuiConnectionsManager.ts`)
- ✅ Created singleton TUI connection manager
- ✅ Implemented registration, removal, and message handling
- ✅ Added project association support
- ✅ Included broadcasting capabilities

### 2. Main Connection Manager (`connectionManager.ts`)
- ✅ Added TUI manager instance
- ✅ Updated registration to handle 'tui' connection type
- ✅ Updated connection removal to handle TUIs
- ✅ Modified all connection methods to include TUIs
- ✅ Added `getTuiConnectionManager()` method

### 3. Type Definitions
- ✅ Extended `ClientConnection.type` to include 'tui'
- ✅ Extended `ConnectionInfo.type` to include 'tui'
- ✅ Updated `ConnectionParams` to include `tuiId`
- ✅ Updated `ClientType` to include 'tui'

### 4. WebSocket Server (`websocketServer.ts`)
- ✅ Added TUI client type to constants
- ✅ Implemented `registerTui()` method
- ✅ Updated auto-registration logic to handle TUI clients
- ✅ Updated message routing to handle TUI connections
- ✅ Updated registration confirmation to support TUI instance IDs

### 5. TUI Client (`wsclient.go`)
- ✅ Changed registration from 'app' to 'tui' client type

## How It Works

1. **TUI Startup**: The Go TUI client connects to the WebSocket server
2. **Registration**: TUI sends `{"type": "register", "clientType": "tui"}`
3. **Server Processing**: Server recognizes 'tui' client type and routes to TUI connection manager
4. **Connection Management**: TUI is registered in the TUI connection manager
5. **Message Routing**: Messages to/from TUI are properly routed through the system

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Start the agent server:
```bash
cd remoteexecutor/updatedAgentServer
npm run dev
```

2. Start the TUI client:
```bash
cd tui/gotui
go run cmd/gotui/main.go
```

3. Verify in server logs that TUI connection is registered:
```
[INFO] TuiConnectionsManager: TUI registered: [connection-id]
```

4. Test message sending from TUI using the `test` command in the TUI

## Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: TUI connections are managed separately from apps and agents
- **Scalability**: Easy to add TUI-specific features and logic
- **Consistency**: Follows the same patterns as existing connection managers
- **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing message routing and handling

The TUI client will now properly register as a TUI connection type and receive messages through the dedicated TUI connection manager.
