# Utility Functions Summary

This document summarizes the utility functions that have been created to extract the execute logic from the tool files and organize them into respective utility folders.

## Created Utility Directories

### 1. Search Utilities (`src/utils/search/`)
- **GlobSearch.ts**: Contains `executeGlobSearch` function for file pattern matching
- **GrepSearch.ts**: Contains `executeGrepSearch` function for text search within files
- **Supporting files**: types.ts, constants.ts, sortUtils.ts

### 2. File System Utilities (`src/utils/fileSystem/`)
- **ListDirectory.ts**: Contains `executeListDirectory` function for directory listing
- **ReadFile.ts**: Contains `executeReadFile` function for file reading
- **WriteFile.ts**: Contains `executeWriteFile` function for file writing

### 3. Terminal Utilities (`src/utils/terminal/`)
- **ExecuteCommand.ts**: Contains `executeCommand` function for shell command execution
- **GitAction.ts**: Contains `executeGitAction` function for Git operations

## Usage

The utility functions can be imported and used directly:

```typescript
// Import search utilities
import { executeGlobSearch, executeGrepSearch } from './utils/search';

// Import file system utilities
import { executeListDirectory, executeReadFile, executeWriteFile } from './utils/fileSystem';

// Import terminal utilities
import { executeCommand, executeGitAction } from './utils/terminal';
```

## Integration with FileServices.ts

The FileServices.ts file has been updated to export these utility functions for easy access:

```typescript
// In FileServices.ts
import { executeGlobSearch } from '../utils/search/GlobSearch';
import { executeGrepSearch } from '../utils/search/GrepSearch';
import { executeListDirectory } from '../utils/fileSystem/ListDirectory';
import { executeReadFile } from '../utils/fileSystem/ReadFile';
import { executeWriteFile } from '../utils/fileSystem/WriteFile';

// Export the utility functions
export { 
  executeGlobSearch,
  executeGrepSearch,
  executeListDirectory,
  executeReadFile,
  executeWriteFile
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each utility is self-contained and can be used independently
2. **Reusability**: Functions can be imported and used in multiple places
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to utility functions only need to be made in one place
4. **Testability**: Each utility can be tested independently

## Note on FileServices.ts Structure

The FileServices.ts file currently references a `fsutils` directory that does not exist in the codebase. This appears to be an inconsistency in the project structure. The utility functions have been added in a way that works with the existing structure while providing access to the new functionality.
