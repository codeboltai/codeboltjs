The `codebolt.browser.screenshot()` function captures a screenshot of the current page displayed in the browser. This function returns a promise that resolves with the screenshot data. The screenshot includes the visible portion of the webpage as it appears in the browser viewport. This function is helpful for various purposes such as visual verification, debugging, automated testing, generating documentation, or creating visual records of web pages during automation workflows.
