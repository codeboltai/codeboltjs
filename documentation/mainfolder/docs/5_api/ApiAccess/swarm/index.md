# Swarm API

The Swarm API provides comprehensive multi-agent swarm coordination capabilities, enabling you to manage swarms, agents, teams, roles, and vacancies. This API allows you to orchestrate complex multi-agent systems with fine-grained control over agent organization and responsibilities.

## Overview

The swarm module enables you to:
- **Swarm Management**: Create and manage swarms of AI agents
- **Agent Registration**: Register and manage agents within swarms
- **Team Organization**: Create teams to group agents for specific tasks
- **Role Assignment**: Define roles and assign them to agents
- **Vacancy Management**: Create and manage job vacancies within swarms
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor agent status and swarm health

## Quick Start Example

```js
// Wait for connection
await codebolt.waitForConnection();

// Create a new swarm
const swarm = await codebolt.swarm.createSwarm({
    name: 'Development Team',
    description: 'A swarm for coordinating development tasks',
    allowExternalAgents: false,
    maxAgents: 10
});
console.log('✅ Created swarm:', swarm.data.swarm);

// Register an agent to the swarm
const agent = await codebolt.swarm.registerAgent(swarm.data.swarm.id, {
    name: 'Code Reviewer',
    capabilities: ['code_review', 'testing'],
    agentType: 'internal',
    metadata: { version: '1.0.0' }
});
console.log('✅ Registered agent:', agent.data);

// Create a team
const team = await codebolt.swarm.createTeam(swarm.data.swarm.id, {
    name: 'Frontend Team',
    description: 'Handles frontend development',
    maxMembers: 5,
    createdBy: 'admin'
});
console.log('✅ Created team:', team.data);

// Create and assign a role
const role = await codebolt.swarm.createRole(swarm.data.swarm.id, {
    name: 'Senior Developer',
    description: 'Experienced developer role',
    permissions: ['write', 'review', 'deploy'],
    maxAssignees: 3,
    createdBy: 'admin'
});
console.log('✅ Created role:', role.data);

// Assign role to agent
await codebolt.swarm.assignRole(
    swarm.data.swarm.id,
    role.data.role.id,
    agent.data.agentId
);
console.log('✅ Role assigned successfully');
```

## Response Structure

All swarm API functions return responses with a consistent structure:

```js
{
    success: boolean,
    requestId?: string,
    data?: {
        // Response-specific data
        swarm: Swarm,
        agents: SwarmAgent[],
        team: Team,
        role: Role,
        // ... etc
    },
    error?: {
        code: string,
        message: string,
        details?: any
    }
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Swarms
A **swarm** is a collection of AI agents working together towards common goals. Each swarm has its own configuration, agents, teams, and roles.

### Agents
An **agent** is an AI entity that can perform tasks. Agents can be internal (managed by the system) or external (connected via external endpoints).

### Teams
A **team** is a subgroup of agents within a swarm, organized for specific purposes or projects.

### Roles
A **role** defines a set of responsibilities and permissions within a swarm. Agents can be assigned to roles to control their capabilities and access.

### Vacancies
A **vacancy** represents an open position within a swarm that agents can apply for, based on their capabilities and role assignments.

### Status Tracking
Agents can have different statuses: `active`, `idle`, `busy`, or `offline`. This helps in monitoring and coordinating agent activities.
