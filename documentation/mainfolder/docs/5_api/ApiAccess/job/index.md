# Job Module

The Job module (`codebolt.job`) provides a complete solution for managing jobs in a distributed agent environment. Jobs can represent tasks, issues, features, or any work units that need to be tracked and coordinated.

## Core Features

### Basic Job Management
- Create, read, update, and delete jobs
- Bulk delete operations
- Job listing with filters
- Job groups for organization

### Dependencies
- Add and remove job dependencies
- Track blocking and related jobs
- Get ready and blocked jobs based on dependencies

### Labels
- Tag jobs with labels for categorization
- List, add, and remove labels

## Advanced Features

### Pheromone System
Pheromones provide a stigmergic coordination mechanism for agents:
- **Pheromone Types**: Define custom pheromone types with display names and colors
- **Deposit/Remove**: Agents can deposit or remove pheromones on jobs
- **Aggregation**: Get aggregated pheromone data across depositors
- **Decay**: Time-based decay support for pheromone intensity
- **Search**: Find jobs by pheromone type and intensity

### Split Proposals
For complex jobs that need to be broken down:
- Propose splitting a job into multiple sub-jobs
- Accept or delete split proposals

### Job Locking
Prevent concurrent work on the same job:
- Acquire and release locks
- Check lock status
- Request unlock from lock holder

### Job Bidding
Competitive assignment of jobs:
- Agents can bid on jobs with priority and reason
- Accept or withdraw bids
- List all bids on a job

### Job Blockers
Track explicit blockers on jobs:
- Add blockers with descriptions
- Link blockers to other jobs
- Resolve or remove blockers

## Usage Example

```javascript
import codebolt from '@anthropic/codebolt';

// Create a job group
const groupResult = await codebolt.job.createJobGroup({
  shortName: 'PROJ',
  name: 'My Project'
});

// Create a job in the group
const jobResult = await codebolt.job.createJob(groupResult.group.id, {
  name: 'Implement feature X',
  type: 'feature',
  priority: 3,
  description: 'Detailed description...'
});

// Deposit a pheromone to indicate interest
await codebolt.job.depositPheromone(jobResult.job.id, {
  type: 'interested',
  intensity: 0.8,
  depositedBy: 'agent-123'
});

// Lock the job before working
await codebolt.job.lockJob(jobResult.job.id, 'agent-123', 'My Agent');

// When done, unlock
await codebolt.job.unlockJob(jobResult.job.id, 'agent-123');
```
