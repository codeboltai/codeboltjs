### Examples

#### Example 1: Release Files

```typescript
import codebolt from '@codebolt/codeboltjs';

await codebolt.waitForConnection();

const result = await codebolt.mail.releaseFiles({
  agentId: 'agent-001',
  files: ['src/auth/login.ts', 'src/auth/session.ts']
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log('Files released successfully');
  console.log('Other agents can now edit these files');
}
```

### Common Use Cases

- **Task Completion**: Release files after finishing work
- **Handoff**: Transfer file access to other agents
- **Cleanup**: Remove reservations when no longer needed

### Notes

- Must be called by the agent that reserved the files
- Frees files for other agents to reserve
- Important for workflow continuation
