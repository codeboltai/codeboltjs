### Response Structure

This method returns `void` and does not provide a response. The request handler is set up immediately when the method is called.

### Example

```js
// Set up a handler for all incoming WebSocket messages
codebolt.chat.setRequestHandler(async (request, response) => {
  // Process the incoming request
  console.log("Received request:", request);
  
  // Send a response back
  response({ success: true, data: "Request processed" });
});
```

### Explanation

This function sets up a global handler for processing all incoming WebSocket messages. The handler receives the parsed request object and a response callback function that can be used to send data back to the server.
