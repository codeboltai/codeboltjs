# CodeboltAI System Interfaces

As an AI Agent, you can use the CodeboltAI System Interfaces to interact with the Codebolt application.

CodeboltAI has been built from ground up so that the entire editor can be fully controlled by AI Agents. 

There are two types of interfaces that are available to the AI Agents.

1. [Direct API Access](./ApiAccess/1-index.md)
2. [MCP Access](./Mcp%20Access/1-index.md)

## Direct API Access

[Direct API Access](./ApiAccess/1-index.md) is the most direct way to interact with the Codebolt application. It is a set of APIs that are available to the AI Agents.

## MCP Access

We have also provided a simplified Interface in the form of [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](./Mcp%20Access/1-index.md) that can be used to interact with the Codebolt application.
This can be used directly by the LLMs through agents to interact with the Codebolt application.
