# Multi-Agents Overview

Multi-agent systems in Codebolt AI Editor represent the next evolution of development automation - coordinated teams of AI agents working together to tackle complex tasks that require different specializations and perspectives.

## Introduction

While individual agents excel at specific tasks, real-world development challenges often require multiple types of expertise working in harmony. Multi-agent systems orchestrate specialized agents to collaborate, share information, and coordinate their actions to achieve complex goals that would be difficult or impossible for a single agent to handle effectively.

Think of multi-agent systems as your AI development team - with specialists for frontend, backend, testing, security, documentation, and deployment all working together under intelligent coordination.

## Basic Concepts

### Agent Coordination
Multi-agent systems manage how agents communicate, share data, and coordinate their actions:

```
Frontend Agent ←→ Coordinator ←→ Backend Agent
       ↓                              ↓
Test Agent    ←→  Coordinator  ←→  Security Agent
       ↓                              ↓
Documentation Agent  ←→  Deployment Agent
```

### Shared Context
All agents in a multi-agent system share contextual information:
- Project structure and dependencies
- Code changes and their impact
- Previous analysis results
- User preferences and team conventions
- Real-time collaboration state

### Workflow Orchestration
The system manages complex workflows with dependencies:
- Sequential execution (Agent B waits for Agent A)
- Parallel execution (Agents run simultaneously)  
- Conditional branching (Agent C runs only if Agent A finds issues)
- Loop-back mechanisms (Iterate until criteria are met)
