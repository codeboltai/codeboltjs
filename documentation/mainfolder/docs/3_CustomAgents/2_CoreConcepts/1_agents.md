Agents 


## Overview of an Agent
Agents are the core building blocks of the Codebolt AI Editor.  
They represent **AI-powered entities** that can perform coding tasks, answer queries, or run workflows.


## Creating Agents
- **UI** → Create visually from the editor.  
- **CLI** → Create via command-line commands.  
- **Prompt Builder** → Build using structured advanced prompts.  


## Agent Lifecycle
1. **Initialization** → Define purpose and capabilities.  
2. **Execution** → Interact with tools, chats, and task flows.  
3. **Remixing/Customization** → Extend existing agents.  


## Why Use Agents?
- Modular AI units for coding workflows.  
- Easy to **remix or extend**.  
- Foundation for **multi-agent orchestration**.
