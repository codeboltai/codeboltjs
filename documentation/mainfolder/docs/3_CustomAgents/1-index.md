# Introduction

Codebolt is built from the ground up to support custom, code-based agents. Unlike other code editors where the agent logic is a closed "secret sauce" (or forks where the core agent behavior is buried in the editor), Codebolt exposes clear, composable APIs so you can implement and own the full agent behavior in code.


# Developer Guide

The Developer Guide explains how to build, extend, and customize the **Codebolt AI Editor**.  
Here youâ€™ll find everything you need to understand agent creation, CLI commands, tools, task flow, and integration with remote execution providers.
