# Composable Pattern Agent Framework

The Composable Pattern works is a simpler Agent which runs the Agentic Loop internally. It takes specific details like instructions, tools, model, workflows and then it runs the agentic Loop internally.

This is typically used for cases where you want to run simple agentic Loops, whith not too much configurations. For Example the Instructions assume that you will fully form the instruction externally and then pass the instruction which will be used directly. This is different from other agents like Builder Pattern and Processor Pattern where they give you option For creating the Instruction also internally.

Composable Framework can be used when you want to have greater control of the prompt creation rather than prompt being generated by the agent.

Tha Example of Composable Framework is:

```ts
export const documentAgent = new ComposableAgent({
	name: 'Document Processing Agent',
	instructions: 'Your Instrcution Here, Single or Multi-Line',
	model: 'default', // References configuration in codeboltagents.yaml
	tools: { processDocumentTool },
	memory: createCodeBoltAgentMemory(),
	maxTurns: 1
});
```

You can then run this using 

```ts
const result = await documentAgent.execute('User Task');
```
