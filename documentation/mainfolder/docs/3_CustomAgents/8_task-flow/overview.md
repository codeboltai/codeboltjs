# Task Flow Overview

Task Flow is Codebolt AI Editor's powerful workflow automation system that orchestrates complex development processes by combining agents, tools, and human interactions into seamless, intelligent workflows. Think of it as your personal DevOps pipeline that can be customized for any development workflow, from simple code transformations to complete CI/CD processes.

## Introduction

Modern software development involves numerous repetitive tasks: code reviews, testing, documentation generation, deployment, and more. Task Flow automates these processes while maintaining intelligent decision-making and human oversight where needed.

Unlike simple scripts or static pipelines, Task Flow workflows are intelligent and adaptive. They can make decisions based on code analysis, respond to changing conditions, integrate with external services, and learn from outcomes to improve future executions.
