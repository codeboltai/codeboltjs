# User interface 

Codebolt AI Editor is an intelligent coding environment. It combines a familiar layout of files on the left, a code editor in the center, an AI-powered chat panel on the right, and an integrated terminal at the bottom — giving you everything you need to build and interact with AI agents in one place.

## Basic layout

The Codebolt AI Editor provides a familiar yet powerful workspace designed for coding with AI assistance. The main interface is divided into the following sections:

- **Primary Sidebar:** contains different views such as the Explorer, Version Control, Debug, Task Flow, Agent Hooks, Running Agents, and Environment Provider. These views assist you in navigating your project, managing files, monitoring agents, and controlling your development environment.

- **Editor:** The main coding area where you open, write, and edit your files. Supports multiple tabs for working across different files at once.

- **Configure Bar:** A quick-access toolbar containing actions like Run Project, Help, Settings, Go to File, Project Setting,Command Palette,  and more. It lets you configure and control your coding environment.

- **Chat & Extensions** Provides AI-powered chat for interacting with your agents. You can also access extensions such as Git, Terminal, Planner, Preview, Browser, Tasks, and other development tools.

## Version Control

Version Control helps you manage changes in your project files. You can track edits, commit updates, and roll back if needed. It makes teamwork easier by keeping a history of all changes.

## Mode

The Mode option lets you switch between different coding environments like Basic, Dev, and Power Dev. Each mode is designed for a different level of workflow — from simple edits to advanced development

## Chat

The Chat panel allows you to directly interact with AI agents. You can ask questions, run tasks, or get coding help without leaving the editor. It’s like having an assistant built into your workspace.


## Explorer view

The Explorer shows your project’s structure with all files and folders. It helps you open, organize, and manage project resources quickly. This is the main place to navigate your codebase. You can drag and drop file one location to another location.

## Command Palette
The Command Palette is a quick-access tool for running commands. Instead of searching through menus, you can open it and type the action you need. It saves time and speeds up your workflow.
