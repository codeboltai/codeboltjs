# Checkpoints

Sometimes you may want to revert to a previous state of your codebase. Codebolt helps you with this by automatically creating checkpoints of your codebase at each request you make, as well every time the AI makes changes to your codebase.

To revert to a previous state, you can either:

- Click the `Restore Checkpoint` button that appears within the input box of a previous request
- Click the + button that shows at the left of a message in the chat history when hovered
