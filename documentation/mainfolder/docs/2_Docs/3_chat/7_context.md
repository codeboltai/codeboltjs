# Context

Chat understands your codebase by analyzing:

1. **Open files**: What you're currently viewing
2. **@ Symbol**: Use @ to select specific files, folders, and docs you want to reference
3. **# Symbol**: Used to select a specific agent from the agent marketplace

### Using @ to Select Content

The @ symbol lets you precisely choose what Chat should focus on:

- **@filename.js** - Select a specific file
- **@foldername/** - Include an entire folder
- **@docs/** - Reference documentation files
