# Agent in chat

Chat offers different modes optimized for specific tasks:

- **Auto**: Acts as a universal agentâ€”Codebolt will autonomously understand your codebase and make broad, codebase-wide changes as needed.
- **Ask**: Get explanations, answers, and feature planning help from the AI about your codebase.
- **Act**: Make targeted edits using only the specific context you provide.
- **Local Agent**: Create a custom agent tailored to your unique workflows.
