# Introduction

The CodeBolt Registry is your comprehensive marketplace for discovering, exploring, and integrating powerful AI agents and MCP tools that extend and enhance your development workflow. This centralized hub provides access to a curated collection of specialized tools designed to streamline various aspects of software development.

## What is the CodeBolt Registry?

The CodeBolt Registry serves as the central marketplace for two main categories of development enhancers:

- **AI Agents**: Intelligent assistants that automate specific development tasks
- **MCP Tools**: Model Context Protocol tools that provide specialized functionality

## AI Agents Marketplace

CodeBolt agents are intelligent AI assistants that leverage CodeBolt's APIs to interact with your code editor. Unlike other editors that provide a single core agent, CodeBolt takes a different approach where it allows you to write your own agents and agent logic.


**Key Differentiators:**
- **Code-Based Agents**: Write custom code that includes any process, workflows, and agentic AI logic
- **Full Editor Control**: Access to complete editor APIs for comprehensive control
- **Custom Workflows**: Create complex, multi-step automation processes
- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with various development tools and services

### Types of CodeBolt Agents

#### 1. Custom Code-Based Agents
The real power of CodeBolt comes with custom code-based agents that provide:
- **Complete Editor APIs**: Full access to file manipulation, code editing, and task automation
- **Custom Logic**: Write sophisticated agent behaviors and workflows
- **Tool Utilization**: Integrate with any available tools and APIs
- **LLM Integration**: Leverage large language models for intelligent decision making

#### 2. Remix Agents
A simpler, cursor-style agent creation method that allows:
- **Model Flexibility**: Change the underlying AI model used by the agent
- **MCP Configuration**: Modify Model Context Protocol settings
- **Real-time Adjustments**: Make changes without deploying new agent versions
- **Local MCP Support**: Use local computing resources for enhanced privacy and control

### How CodeBolt Agents Work

CodeBolt agents operate through an agentic process flow that combines:

1. **User Intent Understanding**: Parsing and interpreting user requests
2. **Task Planning**: Breaking down complex tasks into actionable steps
3. **Tool Utilization**: Using available tools and APIs to accomplish tasks
4. **Code Manipulation**: Reading, writing, and modifying code files
5. **Decision Making**: Using LLM reasoning to make intelligent choices
6. **Result Delivery**: Providing feedback and results to users

### Agent Architecture

CodeBolt agents work within a sophisticated architecture:

- **Agent Runtime Environment**: Isolated execution environment for each agent
- **Communication Protocols**: Standardized communication between agents and the editor
- **Tool Integration**: Access to file systems, LLM providers, and MCP services
- **State Management**: Persistent state across agent interactions
