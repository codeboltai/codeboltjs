This page provides a guide for organizing folders and files in Codebolt.

You could write everything in a single file, or separate each agent, tool.

The `.codeboltAgents` folder contains two subfolders:

**agents:** This folder contains all the local `agents` for the project.

**tools:** This folder contains all the local `tools` for the project.
