# Agent Introduction

Codebolt is an extremely powerful AI driven coding system. Think of Codebolt as the Selenium of code editors. Just like Selenium or Playwright lets you control an entire browser. Similarly, Codebolt allows agents to control the entire code editor. Codebolt has been built from ground up for the AI-Egentic era. 

Unlike other editors like cursor where they have a single agent that is the core of the application, CodeBolt takes a different approach where it allows you to write your own agents and the agent logics.

## What is a Codebolt Agent?

Codebolt agents are intelligent AI assistants that leverage Codebolt's APIs to interact with your code editor. They analyze user requirements, communicate with large language models (LLMs), and execute actions like code editing, file manipulation, and task automation within your development environment.

## What is it different?

Codebolt agents are fundamentally different from other agents like in cursors or trae. Other code editors provide you with an option to create a custom code agent only by changing the core prompt or by selecting the available tools. On the contrary, a code bolt agent provides you with actual editor APIs for you or the AI to interact with the editor. Code bolt agents are code based agents where you can write custom codes which might include any process, any workflows along with agentic AI logics. While we also support a very simple cursor style agent creation called as [remix agents](/docs/developer/agents/remixagents/aboutremixagents) but the real power of code bolt comes with custom code-based agents.

## How Agents Work

Codebolt agents operate through an agentic process flow that combines:

1. **User Intent Understanding**: Parsing and interpreting user requests
2. **Task Planning**: Breaking down complex tasks into actionable steps
3. **Tool Utilization**: Using available tools and APIs to accomplish tasks
4. **Code Manipulation**: Reading, writing, and modifying code files
5. **Decision Making**: Using LLM reasoning to make intelligent choices
6. **Result Delivery**: Providing feedback and results to users

## Agent Architecture

This is a very high level architecture of Codebolt and Agent Interaction. The Codebolt Application handles the orchestration of the agents based on the user chat and provides services for agents to use.

## Agent Flow

The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete flow of how a user request is processed through Codebolt and agents:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

    
    participant User
    box Codebolt Editor
        participant Codebolt as Editor UI
        participant LLM as LLM Service
        participant Tools as MCP Services
        participant ServiceMgr as Service Manager
    end
    participant Agent as Custom Agent
    
    User->>Codebolt: Send request/message
    Note over User,Codebolt: User types a request in chat
    
    Codebolt->>Agent: Start agent & forward message
    Note over Codebolt,Agent: Agent Orchestrator routes to appropriate agent
    

        Agent->>ServiceMgr: Send LLM request with context
        Note over Agent,ServiceMgr: Agent calls LLM service via Service Manager
        
        ServiceMgr->>LLM: Route to LLM provider
        Note over ServiceMgr,LLM: Service Manager handles LLM routing
        
        LLM->>ServiceMgr: Return response with tool calls
        ServiceMgr->>Agent: Forward LLM response
        Note over ServiceMgr,Agent: LLM suggests actions and tools to use
    
    loop Till LLM suggests to stop
        Agent->>ServiceMgr: Request tool execution
        Note over Agent,ServiceMgr: Agent calls specific tools via Service Manager
        
        ServiceMgr->>Tools: Execute tool/service
        Note over ServiceMgr,Tools: File, code, MCP services, etc.
        
        Tools->>ServiceMgr: Return tool result
        ServiceMgr->>Agent: Send tool result back

    
        Agent->>ServiceMgr: Send tool results for next LLM call
        Note over Agent,ServiceMgr: Agent reports tool execution results
        
        ServiceMgr->>LLM: Send results to LLM
        LLM->>ServiceMgr: Return next steps or completion
        ServiceMgr->>Agent: Forward LLM response
    end

        Agent->>Codebolt: Task Completed, Send completion message
        Codebolt->>User: Display final result

```

But again you are not limited to this flow. You can write your own agent logic and use the CodeboltJS library to interact with the editor.

## Sample Agent Flow Code

Here's a complete example of how an agent handles a user request using the **CodeboltJS library**:

```javascript
// Main agent entry point - handles incoming user messages
codebolt.onMessage((userMessage)=> {
    try {
        // 1. Extract context
        const projectContext = await codebolt.project.getContext();
        
        // 2. Get available tools for the agent
        const tools = await codebolt.tools.listToolsFromToolBoxes(["codebolt", "filesystem"]);
        
        // 3. Prepare conversation with system context
        const messages = [
            {
                role: "system",
                content: "You are a helpful coding assistant. Analyze the user request and use available tools to complete the task."
            },
            {
                role: "user", 
                content: `${userMessage}\n\nProject context: ${JSON.stringify(projectContext)}`
            }
        ];
        
        // 4. Start conversation loop with LLM
        let isTaskComplete = false;
        let conversationHistory = [...messages];
        
        while (!isTaskComplete) {
            // Send request to LLM with available tools
            const llmResponse = await codebolt.llm.chat(conversationHistory, tools);
            
            // 5. Process LLM response and execute tool calls
            if (llmResponse.tool_calls && llmResponse.tool_calls.length > 0) {
                // Execute each tool call requested by LLM
                for (const toolCall of llmResponse.tool_calls) {
                    const toolResult = await codebolt.tools.executeToolCall(toolCall);
                    
                    // Add tool result to conversation
                    conversationHistory.push({
                        role: "tool",
                        tool_call_id: toolCall.id,
                        content: JSON.stringify(toolResult)
                    });
                }
                
                // Get LLM's next response after tool execution
                const followUpResponse = await codebolt.llm.chat(conversationHistory, tools);
                
                // Check if LLM indicates task is complete
                if (followUpResponse.content.includes("task completed") || 
                    !followUpResponse.tool_calls) {
                    isTaskComplete = true;
                    
                    // 6. Send final response to user
                    return followUpResponse.content;
                }
            } else {
                // No tool calls needed, task is complete
                isTaskComplete = true;
                return llmResponse.content;
            }
        }
        
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error in agent:', error);
    }
});
```




### Code Explanation:

1. **Message Handling**: The agent listens for user messages via WebSocket connection
2. **Context Gathering**: Retrieves project context and available tools
3. **LLM Communication**: Sends user request with context to the LLM service
4. **Tool Execution Loop**: 
   - LLM responds with tool calls (file operations, code analysis, etc.)
   - Agent executes each tool via Codebolt's service manager
   - Results are sent back to LLM for next steps
5. **Task Completion**: Loop continues until LLM indicates the task is finished
6. **User Response**: Final result is sent back to the user through Codebolt UI

This example demonstrates the complete agent flow from the sequence diagram above, showing how agents use the **CodeboltJS library** to:

## Agent Communication Protocol

Agents communicate with Codebolt through a structured protocol:

```javascript
// Message Structure
{
    type: "userMessage",
    content: "Generate a React component for user profile",
    context: {
        projectPath: "/path/to/project",
        currentFile: "src/App.js",
        selectedText: "...",
        metadata: {...}
    }
}

// Response Structure
{
    success: true,
    message: "Created UserProfile component successfully",
    actions: [
        {
            type: "fileCreate",
            path: "src/components/UserProfile.js",
            content: "..."
        }
    ]
}
```
