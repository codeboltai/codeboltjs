# Action Agents
Action Agents are called whenever the user sends any chat in the editor or asks to perform any action that can be resolved to any agent.

Action Agents are specialized tools or programs that are triggered whenever the user sends a request in the editor or performs an action that can be resolved by a specific agent. There are various agents available in the marketplace, each designed to cater to different types of tasks. You can install and select agents tailored to your specific needs, improving productivity and streamlining workflows.

If existing agents do not fully meet your requirements, you also have the flexibility to create custom agents for specialized tasks. These custom agents can be configured to handle unique workflows or specialized processes in ways that generic agents might not.

**Some trending agents in the marketplace include:**

* CodeBolt Dev: Ideal for development tasks, CodeBolt Dev assists with code generation, debugging, and refactoring.
* CodeBolt Web Deployment: Facilitates smooth deployment of web applications by automating steps from build to release.
* CodeBolt Aider: Offers additional help for troubleshooting and minor task automation, particularly useful for support functions.
* CodeBolt Pilot: Acts as an all-in-one assistant for larger projects, handling multiple aspects of development, deployment, and optimization.
